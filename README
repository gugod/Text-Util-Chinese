NAME

    Text::Util::Chinese - A collection of subroutines for processing
    Chinese Text

Exportable Subroutines

    extract_words( $input_iter ) #=> ArrayRef[Str]

      This extracts words from Chinese text. A word in Chinese text is a
      token token with N charaters. These N characters is often used
      together in the input and therefore should be a meaningful unit.

      The input parameter is a iterator -- a subroutine that must return a
      string of Chinese text each time it is invoked. Or, when the input is
      exhausted, it must return undef. For example:

          open my $fh, '<', 'book.txt';
          my $words = extract_words(
              sub {
                  my $x = <$fh>;
                  return decode_utf8 $x;
              });

      The type of return value is ArrayRef[Str].

      It is likely that this subroutine returns an empty ArrayRef with no
      contents. It is only useful when the volume of input is a leats a few
      thousands of characters. The more, the better.
